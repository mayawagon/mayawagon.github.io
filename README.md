# mayawagon.github.io
Code for the portfolio site of Maya M. Wagoner, Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellow at the Brooklyn Public Library.

Uses the [Lavar Jekyll Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/lavar-portfolio-agency-jekyll-theme/15679321).

Also, secretly, worklog.md contains a list of all the (work) things Maya does every day.
